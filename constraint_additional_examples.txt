1. AXI Transaction Generator.

Create a class AXI_Transaction to represent transactions on an AXI bus. Include fields: addr, data, burst_type, len (length of burst), and id.

Constraints:

The addr should be aligned to the burst size (len * 4 bytes).

Allow burst_type values: INCR (1) and WRAP (2) only.

The len must be between 1 and 16.

Randomize a unique id for each transaction.

Challenge: Generate 10 AXI transactions and verify that all generated addresses are aligned based on the burst length.

2. Cache Line Generator for a CPU

Design a CacheLine class with fields: tag, index, data[8] (8 words), and valid_bit.

Constraints:

Randomize the index value within [0:127].

Assign the tag a unique value for each index.

Ensure the data array is randomized such that no two words have the same value.

Set valid_bit = 1 for all generated lines.

Challenge: Generate 128 cache lines with unique tag-index pairs, ensuring the data uniqueness constraint is met.
